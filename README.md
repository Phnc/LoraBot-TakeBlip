# LoraBot-TakeBlip
API used to retrieve data for a ChatBot created using the Take Blip platform

This project was deployed to heroku and is available on the following link: https://lorabot-api.herokuapp.com/repositories

Please note the due to heroku limitations it might be offline.
Also, as the project couldn't be inside a subdirectory to be deployed to heroku, I had to create a separate repository with just the API code. The link is the following: https://github.com/Phnc/LoraBot-API. But the code is the same as the one in this repository.
